[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/miniflux/miniflux2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/miniflux/miniflux2)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/miniflux/badge/?version=latest)](https://docs.miniflux.net/)

Miniflux is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader:

- Written in Go (Golang)
- Works only with Postgresql
- Doesn't use any ORM
- Doesn't use any complicated framework
- The number of features is volountary limited

It's simple, fast, lightweight and super easy to install.

Miniflux 2 is a rewrite of Miniflux 1.x in Golang.
